# Program About :- A hashing program to store the password with a hash.

=> In program, there will be a dictionary storing key-value pairs like "a" = "1", etc.
=> Program will run like an interface with menu controlled by 0-9 numbers.

# What it will do :-
> Program will ask from the user for his/her details to make an account (a record in a excel file) like name, age, Email Id and a password which will be 
  stored by the process of hashing. 
  - like let say the users password is "cat" then at our side (in excel file) it will not be stored as "cat", our program will change the password "cat"
  according to our hashing programme let say "123"


# How it will :-
> in execl file, users details will be stored and hashed password will be stored by opening the excel file and the entry will be done and then the excel file
  will be closed.
** > An additional text or excel file to store the actual password with hash password for knowledge purpose.

# Addition to the program:
> User can access his/her details by entering a password which will be matched with the hash password then his/her details will be displayed.
